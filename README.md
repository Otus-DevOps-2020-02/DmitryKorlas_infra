# Homework: Lecture 5. Bastion host connection

1. oneliner to connect to the someinternalhost throught proxy host (35.210.87.16)

```bash
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/appuser -o ProxyCommand="ssh appuser@35.210.87.16 -W %h:%p" appuser@someinternalhost
```
or
```bash
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/appuser -A -J appuser@35.210.87.16 appuser@someinternalhost
```

2. using sshconfig

add this fragment into ~/.ssh/host
(see https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/ssh-proxy-bastion-proxyjump)
```bash
### The Bastion Host
Host bastion
  HostName 35.210.87.16 # external IP
  User appuser
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/appuser

### The Remote Host
Host someinternalhost
  HostName 10.132.0.3 # internal network IP
  User appuser
  ProxyJump bastion
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/appuser
```
then, use this command to access someinternalhost
```bash
$ ssh someinternalhost
```

## Homework results:

bastion_IP = 35.210.87.16
someinternalhost_IP = 10.132.0.3

# Homework: Lecture 8. Terraform

## the task :star:
> add ssh key for user appuser_web using web GUI into the project metadata. What kind of issues you're see?

1. I see a message "SSH keys must be unique. The key has been already added.". So, it's unable to use the same key for multiple users.
2. When I invoke `terraform apply` - the manually added ssh key (appuser_web) has been replaced by the values from terraform config. So, I see it's not reasonable to change VM instance settings manually (using web GUI) when it controlled by terraform. All changes will be overwritten by terraform during `terafform apply`.

## the task :star::star:
> manually add reddit-app2 as a second instance. What kind of problem in this configuration?

The problem here is verbosity of config. We should not copy paste the same configuration. Keep DRY (dont repeat yourself) principles.
So, for solving this issue, we can use `count` parameter - it's helpful for creating multiple resources.

# Homework: Lecture 9. Terraform

got the error in output:

*Error: Error creating Address: googleapi: Error 409: The resource 'projects/MY_PROJECT_ID/regions/europe-west1/addresses/reddit-app-ip' already exists, alreadyExists*

# Homework: Lecture 10. Ansible - basics.

Ansible can run commands on multiple hosts. There are few ways to do it.
- using cli
    - ansible app -m command -a 'ls -la'
    - ansible app -m shell -a 'ls -la'
- using playbook
    - ansible-playbook clone.yml

few examples:
```shell script
# cloning the repo
ansible app -m git -a 'repo=https://github.com/express42/reddit.git dest=/home/appuser/reddit_ansible'
ansible app -m command -a 'git clone https://github.com/express42/reddit.git /home/appuser/reddit_ansible'
```
```shell script
# check service status
ansible db -m service -a name=mongod
ansible db -m systemd -a name=mongod
ansible db -m command -a 'systemctl status mongod'
```
```shell script
# run multiple commands at once
ansible app -m shell -a 'ruby -v; bundler -v'
```
```shell script
# run command on all hosts (using './inventory.yml' YAML config)
ansible all -m ping -i inventory.yml
```
```shell script
# run command using './inventory' file
ansible dbserver -m command -a uptime
```
```shell script
# see the tree of available hosts
ansible-inventory --graph
```
```shell script
# passing env variables
ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_ENABLED=gcp_compute $(which ansible-inventory) -i gcp_compute.yml --list --export -vvvvv
```

**ansible-playbook** command return statuses. In case ansible think it change something on host it report **changed=N** in the result output. This behaviour could be adjusted using changed_when parameter. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_error_handling.html#overriding-the-changed-result for further reading.

Question: run `ansible-playbook clone.yml` multiple times. Review output. Then remove the destination folder and run `ansible-playbook clone.yml` again. What's going on and why.
Answer: so, when we run the command git clone multiple times with the same params, it will return such outputs: ansible will see there are no differences, and return the
```shell script
ansible-playbook clone.yml
# appserver                  : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0

ansible-playbook clone.yml
# appserver                  : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0

ansible app -m command -a 'rm -rf reddit'
ansible-playbook clone.yml
# appserver                  : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
```
According to the output we see that ansible does not detect the changes when git clone called multiple times.

## the task :star:
Add a static json file for inventory. Make sure `ansible all -m ping` works correctly.

Added `inventory.static.json`. To run it, use this command `ansible all -m ping -i inventory.static.json`.

## the task :star::star:
Implement a script for dynamic inventory
Added a script *get-puma-inventory.sh* - it will receive an ip addresses from gcloud.
To run the external script, ansible.cfg has a parameter *inventory*.

This line indicates that external script will be called.
```shell script
# ansible.cfg
inventory = ./get-puma-inventory.sh
```

so, this command is configured with the dynamic inventory.
```
ansible all -m ping
```

# Homework: Lecture 11. Ansible - playbooks advanced.

```shell script
# run playbook in check mode (aka dry run).
# --limits means limit the groups of hosts to apply the playbook.
ansible-playbook reddit_app.yml --check --limit db
```

```shell script
# --tags will filter tasks by tag name.
# --limit will filter by the groups of hosts
# so, this command will run tasks tagged with "db-tag" on hosts in group "db".
ansible-playbook reddit_app.yml --limit db --tags db-tag
```

## Handlers
Ansible has **handlers**. It's can be used for example to restart the service in case of config changes.

## the task :star:
Investigate how to deal with dynamic inventory. Describe and choose the optimal solution.

Dynamic inventory implemented using [gcp_compute module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/inventory/gcp_compute.html).

To configure it, we have to follow few steps:
1. #### add service account file
    We have to add service account keys for accessing gcloud resources. Please follow [creating-managing-service-account-keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#iam-service-account-keys-create-gcloud).

2. #### install "requests" and "google-auth" dependencies
    ```shell script
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. #### add inventory.gcp_compute.yml
    Then call following command to see the inventory. Note, that `$(which ansible-inventory)` is used because of ansible-inventory unable to use python from the pyenv. See [please-install-google-auth-library-ansible-problem](https://emilwypych.com/2019/09/29/please-install-google-auth-library-ansible-problem/?cn-reloaded=1) and [how-to-change-python-version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59716485/ansible-how-to-change-python-version)

    ```shell script
    $(which ansible-inventory) -i gcp_compute.yml --list --export -vvvv
    ```
    ```shell script
    $(which ansible-inventory) -i inventory.gcp_compute.yml --graph
    # should output:
    @all:
      |--@app:
      |  |--reddit-app
      |--@db:
      |  |--reddit-db
      |--@ungrouped:
    ```
4. #### adjust playbooks to set parameters like IP addresses from the dynamic inventory
    ```shell script
    # in app.yml
    db_host: "{{ hostvars[groups['db'][0]]['ansible_internal_host'] }}"
    ```
5. #### re-build packer images (optional)
    ```shell script
    cd PROJECT_ROOT
    packer build  -var-file=./packer/variables.json ./packer/db.json
    packer build  -var-file=./packer/variables.json ./packer/app.json
    ```
6. #### re-create environment using terraform
    ```shell script
    cd PROJECT_ROOT/terraform/stage
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```
7. #### run ansible playbook scripts
    ```shell script
    cd PROJECT_ROOT/ansible
    ansible-playbook site.yml
    ```
8. #### check the app using it external IP address
    now, the app configured and ready to use.

# Homework: Lecture 12. Ansible - roles end environments.
Ansible role is mechanism of reusing and decomposition of ansible code. It could be used to isolate a configuration of the component into re-usible block of configuration. It contains it's own tasks, templates, variables and files. As example, application can have role for db and another role for app server. It's the different components with the specific configuration.

```shell script
# skaffolding for the new role 'app'
ansible-galaxy init app
```

Ansible has an environments mechanism. It helps to set the different variables depends on environment. For example, log level can be set to debug for stage env, but set to error for production env.
```shell script
# multi-env example. deploy to prod
ansible-playbook -i environments/prod/inventory deploy.yml
```

Using ansible it's possible to use community roles. To install it, run this command:
```shell script
# install dependencies
ansible-galaxy install -r environments/stage/requirements.yml
```
then, apply playbook
```shell script
ansible-playbook -i environments/stage/inventory playbooks/site.yml
```
Ansible vault can be used to encrypt secrets or sensitive data.
```shell script
# encrypt
ansible-vault encrypt environments/prod/credentials.yml

# edit encrypted file
ansible-vault edit environments/prod/credentials.yml

# decrypt
ansible-vault decrypt environments/prod/credentials.yml
```
on osx it can raise a warning like *fatal: [dbserver]: FAILED! => {"msg": "crypt.crypt not supported on Mac OS X/Darwin, install passlib python module"}
*. passlib should be installed (it's added to ansible/requirements.txt)

To be able to connect via ssh using login+pass, the target vm (ubuntu 16, GCP) was reconfigured. **It became less secure**, so it's done only for as exercise:
* set `PasswordAuthentication yes` into "/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
* restart ssh `service ssh restart`
* add ip into whitelist `/etc/sshguard/whitelist`
* restart sshguard `service sshguard restart`

## the task :star:
Configure dynamic inventory for environments stage and prod.
The file **inventory.gcp_compute.yml** from the previous homework has been used.

# the task :star::star:
Travis config could be checked [online](https://config.travis-ci.com/explore).
